Marching Cubes Tutorial: lookup tables

Ambiguous.lut.txt contains the numbers of cases whose complementary is changed when solving topology problems (families 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13)

TrianlesS.lut.txt contains the indexes of interpolated vertices to draw when using standard complementary cases

TrianlesA.lut.txt contains the indexes of interpolated vertices to draw when using ambiguous complementary cases

format: 
max of 5 triangles to draw: 5 triangles * 3 vertices = 15 values by entry
TrianglesS[15*number] = v11, v12, v13, v21, v22, v23, v31, v32, v33, v41, v42, v43, v51, v52, v53
where vij is the vertex j of the triangle i



Algorithm structure:

--- 1st version

int cube;
if (resolve ambiguous cases)
	draw(TrianglesA[15*cube]);
else
	if (cube belongs to Ambiguous)
		draw(reverseNormals(TrianglesA(255 - 15*cube)));
	else
		draw(TrianglesA[15*cube]);

--- 2nd version

int cube;
if (resolve ambiguous cases)
	draw(TrianglesA[15*cube]);
else
	draw(TrianglesS[15*cube]);
